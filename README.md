##### A plugin for [RuneLite](https://runelite.net/)
Adds progress bars to the skills tab to show how close the next level ups are

Config options include 
- full colour customisation (Thanks to https://github.com/Matthew-nop)
- option to indent to match skill panel corners
- adjustable bar height
- showing for virtual levels
- showing for goals set using the in-game XP menu
- showing only for the skill you are currently hovering over to reduce clutter

Thanks to a **major** rewrite by https://github.com/Hydrox6, this plugin now uses Jagex Widgets instead of a Runelite
overlay, meaning it can now always render all the bars, and appear *beneath* the XP information tooltips.
